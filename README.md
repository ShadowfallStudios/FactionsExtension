# Factions Extension Plugin

Add factions and relations in your game using C++ or Blueprints

## What are "Factions"
When we say **Faction** we refer to a **group of entities or actors** that can share behavior or data.

Many games use the concept of factions or teams extensively. For example, in FPS games there will be enemies and friends, in RTS games every player will have its own faction, and in open-world games enemies might be part of a group and be hostile (in other words, they share a faction).

This plugin adds this feature to Unreal Engine. It is a very flexible tool that will make the design, editing and behavior of your own factions a trivial part of development.

## "What" can have a faction?
*Everything!*... Being more specific, **all objects**, including **actors and components** can have a faction.
